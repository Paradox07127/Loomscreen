/// live here: the link's target (`step` runs on the render thread), the one-shot
/// carrier that hands the main-created link to the render actor, and the pacing
/// decorator the renderer talks to instead of the MTKView.
///
/// Only `.renderThread` backing uses any of this. `.main` keeps pacing the MTKView
/// through the bare surface, byte-for-byte the pre-M2c2 path.

/// Target of the AppKit-vended `CADisplayLink`. Because the link is added to the
/// render thread's run loop, `step(_:)` fires there — it enters the actor's
/// isolation synchronously and produces exactly one frame, the same shape the old
/// MTKView `draw(in:)` had on the main thread. Holds the actor weakly: the link
/// retains this target and the actor retains the link, so a strong back-reference
/// would leak the actor (and with it the renderer).
